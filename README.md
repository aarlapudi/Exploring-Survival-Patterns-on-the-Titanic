# Titanic Survival Analysis & Visualization


This project explores the famous Titanic dataset using Python and data visualization techniques.
The goal is to uncover relationships and trends that influenced passenger survival, with the help of exploratory data analysis (EDA).

📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset provides details about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, family size, and survival status.
Through a series of visualizations, we identify key survival patterns and gain insights into the factors that determined outcomes during the disaster.
