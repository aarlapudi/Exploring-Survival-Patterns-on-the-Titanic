# Exploring Survival Patterns on the Titanic

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to uncover key factors that influenced passenger survival. Using Python and data visualization libraries, we analyze relationships and trends between age, fare, class, gender, family size, and survival outcomes.

# Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to:

Understand how different features relate to survival (Survived).

Visualize distributions and patterns in the dataset.

Identify key survival trends (e.g., class, gender, age, fare).

Summarize findings in a structured and interpretable way.

# Tools & Libraries Used

Python 3.x

Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis

# Visualizations & Insights

Key plots generated in this project include:

Histograms with KDE – Age and Fare distributions

Boxplots – Survival trends across Age, Fare, and Pclass

Scatterplots – Fare vs Age by Survival

Pairplot – Relationships among numerical features colored by Survival

Heatmap – Correlation matrix of numerical variables
